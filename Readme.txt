Udacity Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree Program
Project: Analyze A/B Test Results
By Sherif Ahmed Abdelmagid Sakr

project Overview
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 
It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

Table of Contents
1- Introduction
2- Part I - Probability
3- Part II - A/B Test
4- Part III - Regression

Introduction
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," 
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page,
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files you need to complete the project, 
are provided for you in a downloadable zip file in the resources tab (as well as under "Supporting Materials" below). 
Note that portions of the notebook reference back to quizzes that are linked in this lesson to ensure you are on the right track.

The Programs and Software I Used
Python 3
HTML, Hypertest Management Language
IPython
Jupyter notebook, anaconda environment
Python libraries, such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels, etc.
